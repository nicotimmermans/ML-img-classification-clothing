# About

This app contains a machine learning model trained on the Zalando Fashion dataset to classify images of clothing pieces. To test the model's accuracy, I wanted to try it on randomized images from the Unsplash API.

# How to run

Requires an Unsplash API key. You can generate one [here](https://unsplash.com/developers)
