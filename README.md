# About

This app contains a machine learning model trained on the Zalando Fashion dataset to classify images of clothing pieces. To test the model's accuracy, I wanted to try it on randomized images from the Unsplash API.

# How to run

Requires an Unsplash API key. You can generate one [here](https://unsplash.com/developers), or ask me to borrow mine üßê
Fill in the apiKey variable in index.html and in the terminal, run 'python app.py'.

# API Limit

Unsplash API's requirements for a production key are out of scope for this little project.
So there's a demo limit 50 requests an hour, you can refresh 5 times each hour..
